What is DNS?
DNS stands for Domain Name System. It is a hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or any resource connected to the Internet or a private network. DNS translates domain names, which are easy-to-remember labels for websites, into the numerical IP addresses needed for locating and identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols.

DNS operates as a distributed database system. When you type a domain name (e.g., www.example.com) into your web browser, your device sends a request to a DNS server to resolve that domain name into the corresponding IP address. DNS servers then work to find the correct IP address associated with the domain name and return it to your device, allowing it to connect to the desired website or service.

DNS plays a crucial role in the functionality of the internet and is essential for navigating the web and accessing various online resources.
